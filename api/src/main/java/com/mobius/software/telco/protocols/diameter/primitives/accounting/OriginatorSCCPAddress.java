	The Originator-SCCP-Address AVP (AVP code 2008) is of type Address. It is the "SCCP calling address" used by the
	messaging node when receiving a message. This is usually the address of the MSC or SGSN/Serving Node that was
	serving the UE when it submitted the message. It contains either a Point Code (ISPC) or a Global Title, where Global
	Title represents an E.164 number. The Address Type discriminator in RFC 6733 [401] is set to value 8, E.164, and the
	address information is UTF8 encoded.

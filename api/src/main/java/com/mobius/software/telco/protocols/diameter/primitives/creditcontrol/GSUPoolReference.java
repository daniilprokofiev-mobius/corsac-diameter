 * 8.30.  G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP

   The G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP (AVP Code 457) is of type Grouped.  It
   is used in the Credit-Control-Answer message and associates the
   Granted-Service-Unit AVP within which it appears with a credit pool
   within the session.

   The G-S-U-Pool-Identifier AVP specifies the credit pool from which
   credit is drawn for this unit type.
   
   The CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for which credit is
   pooled.

   The Unit-Value AVP specifies the multiplier, which converts between
   service units of type CC-Unit-Type and abstract service units within
   the credit pool (and thus to service units of any other services or
   rating-groups associated with the same pool).

   The G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP is defined as follows (per
   grouped-avp-def as defined in [RFC6733]):

           G-S-U-Pool-Reference ::= < AVP Header: 457 >
                                    { G-S-U-Pool-Identifier }
                                    { CC-Unit-Type }
                                    { Unit-Value }

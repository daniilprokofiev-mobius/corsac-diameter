 * 	8.9.  Registration-Termination-Request (RTR) Command

   	The Registration-Termination-Request (RTR) command is indicated by
   	the Command-Code set to 287 and the Command Flags' 'R' bit set.  The
   	Diameter server sends this command to the Diameter client in a SIP
   	server to indicate to the SIP server that one or more SIP AORs have
   	to be deregistered.  The command allows an operator to
   	administratively cancel the registration of a user from a centralized
   	Diameter server.

   	The Diameter server has the capability to initiate the deregistration
   	of a user and inform the SIP server by means of the Diameter RTR
   	command.  The Diameter server can decide whether only one SIP AOR is
   	going to be deregistered, a list of SIP AORs, or all the SIP AORs
   	allocated to the user.

   	The absence of a SIP-AOR AVP in the Diameter RTR message indicates
   	that all the SIP AORs allocated to the user identified by the
   	User-Name AVP are being deregistered.

   	The Diameter server MUST include a SIP-Deregistration-Reason AVP
   	value to indicate the reason for the deregistration.

   	The Message Format of the RTR command is as follows:

    <RTR> ::= < Diameter Header: 287, REQ, PXY >
                 < Session-Id >
                 { Auth-Application-Id }
                 { Auth-Session-State }
                 { Origin-Host }
                 { Origin-Realm }
                 { Destination-Host }
                 { SIP-Deregistration-Reason }
                 [ Destination-Realm ]
                 [ User-Name ]
               * [ SIP-AOR ]
               * [ Proxy-Info ]
               * [ Route-Record ]
               * [ AVP ]

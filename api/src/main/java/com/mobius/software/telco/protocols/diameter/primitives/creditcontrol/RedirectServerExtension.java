 * 8.64.  Redirect-Server-Extension AVP

   The Redirect-Server-Extension AVP (AVP Code 665) is of type Grouped
   and contains the address information of the redirect server (e.g.,
   HTTP redirect server, SIP Server) with which the end user is to be
   connected when the account cannot cover the service cost.  It MUST be
   present inside the QoS-Final-Unit-Indication AVP when the Final-Unit-
   Action AVP is set to REDIRECT.  If the type of the redirect server is
   one of the enumerated values of the Redirect-Address-Type AVP, then
   the credit-control server SHOULD send the information in the
   Redirect-Server AVP, in addition to or instead of the Redirect-
   Server-Extension AVP.  This is done in order to preserve backward
   compatibility with credit-control clients that support only
   [RFC4006].  Exactly one AVP MUST be included inside the Redirect-
   Server-Extension AVP.

   The Redirect-Server-Extension AVP is defined as follows (per
   grouped-avp-def as defined in [RFC6733]):

        Redirect-Server-Extension ::= < AVP Header: 665 >
                                  [ Redirect-Address-IPAddress ]
                                  [ Redirect-Address-URL ]
                                  [ Redirect-Address-SIP-URI ]
                                  [ AVP ]
